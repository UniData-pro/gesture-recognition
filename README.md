# Gesture Recognition Dataset for computer vision tasks
Dataset consists of **10,000+** videos featuring individuals demonstrating **5** distinct hand gestures: "one," "four," "small," "fist," and "me." It helps researchers study **gesture recognition**, especially for **sign language** and **gesture-controlled devices**. The dataset features a wide array of individuals demonstrating gestures, which allows for the analysis of differences in hand shapes, sizes, and movements among various people.

By showcasing different individuals performing the gestures, the videos enable robust training of **machine learning** models and **deep learning techniques**.  - **[Get the data](https://unidata.pro/datasets/gesture-recognition/?utm_source=github.&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=gesture-recognition)**
